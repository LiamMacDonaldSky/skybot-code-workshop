/**
 * Challenge 3: FizzBuzz
 *
 * Problem:
 * Write a program that returns an array of strings where:
 * - For multiples of 3: return "Fizz"
 * - For multiples of 5: return "Buzz"
 * - For multiples of both 3 and 5: return "FizzBuzz"
 * - For all other numbers: return the number as a string
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Input: 15 → Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
 * - Input: 3 → Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
